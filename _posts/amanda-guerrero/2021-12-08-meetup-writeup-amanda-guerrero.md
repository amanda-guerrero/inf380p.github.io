title: "Amanda's Meetup Writeup"
---

For the meetup assignment, I attended the October Austin Python meetup. 

The first speaker was Gunna Kleemann, MIDS PhD. He is a Principal Data Scientist at Austin Data Capital. 
His presentation was on viruses and biological data. He talked about how he uses Python to graph data that helps us better understand viral biology. 
He talked about how he used open-source data that he found on several viruses, including COVID. His analysis was looking at how human proteins interact with viruses. 
Due to time constraints, he ended up going quickly through the code. Looking at the code, there were a few pieces that I recognized from our class. 
While I didn’t understand the nuances of his work, I thought that it was interesting to know that I have the same toolkit available to me.

Dr. Kleeman talked about viral data and python methods. I thought it was very interesting hearing about the work that he did using Python. 
I wasn’t aware how using Python could help us discover information about viruses and pandemics. 
Data has been critical in helping us understand the pandemic and I hadn’t internalized just how far of a reach Python has. 
This portion of the talk expanded my view of how programming can be used. 
I also thought that was comforting how several other people said that they didn’t fully understand that biology, but they could still engage in talking about Python.

The second part of the meetup was a presentation by Dillon Niderhut, PhD. His presentation was on the “Eight Rules of Fast Code: Performance in Python”. 
He gave tips on getting your code to run faster. It wasn’t entirely applicable to me, since I don’t run extensive code that takes too long to run. 
Similar to the first speaker, many of the concepts that he discussed were beyond my level of understanding. 
He showed a tool to measure how much time you spend in each function call, and how often those calls happen. 
He also gave tips such as only running the code as little as possible, not changing the code, and running the code in parallel. 
This was a nice insight into the complexity of Python.  

I thought that it was interesting attending this meetup. Beyond this class, I’m curious about participating in other meetups - particularly, groups for women and minorities. 
I’m also interested in learning and joining discussions about the intersectionality between programming and accessibility. 
Beyond this class, I think in the future I would like to learn other programming languages and attend meetups for those groups, as well.
